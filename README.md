# PerfEst
Toolbox for simulating tissue blood circulation, and estimating the perfusion. 

Currently one example is given in the Frog-folder. Here blood flow through a frog tongue is simulated, and the perfusion is estimated. Note that the data (contrast concentration) are not uploaded to github (due to large size).
